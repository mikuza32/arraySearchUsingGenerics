The purpose of this project is to compare data within in array using the generics method. The usage of the generics method within the created array will tell the user which value is larger than the other. As each name is linked to a value in the array, using the generics method to search through the data and compare for an output as to which value is larger. As there is no specific output the user should be looking for, the only correct output is which ever value is logically larger is printed when ran.
